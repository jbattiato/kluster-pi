# Certificate Manager

`cert-manager` is essential to test services that requires TLS connections. For example when we will install nextcloud in HTTPS.

There are two ways to install it:

1. using the YAML manifest
2. throught Helm 

The `resource/cert-manager/install.sh` contains both, for reference, but only the YAML manifest is active.
